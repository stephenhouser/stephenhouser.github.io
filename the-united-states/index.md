A fun way to learn or relearn the states of the United States of America. You start with interactive map which links to facts about each state. Which includes the flag, population, area, motto, song, bird, flower, and more. Beyond the facts, there are several games that range from basic state identification, finding states on the map, identifying state capitals, to the challenging "motto madness," where you have to identify the state by it's motto.
