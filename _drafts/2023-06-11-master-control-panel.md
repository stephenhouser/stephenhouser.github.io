I like physical old school controls; switches, buttons, and 7-segment displays. I also like quick access to turn on and off things without having to go all over the house. Fortunately home automation and the Internet of Things are helping solve the latter problem. Unfortunately the rest of the world seems to like flat glass panel interfaces (tablets, iPads, etc.) that lack any physical character. Fortunately I have junk boxes full of switches, buttons, and microcontrollers! Mix all those together and you get a very physical _Master Control Panel 1_ that connects via WiFi to my home automation system!

NOTE: The _Master Control Panel 1_ is a prototype that I contine to iterate on and the images and descriptions here are from these initial designs. I expect to continue development and post (irregular) updates here.

## The Problem

I'm lazy and a creature of habit.

I've been using [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) for home automation for a few years, I have never perfected the user interface it presents. There are a ton of really wonderful examples that people have constructed, but I see to lack the aestetic design for tablet interfaces or just the desire to create one. However, I do like
