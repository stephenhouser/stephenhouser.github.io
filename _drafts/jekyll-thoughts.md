Here are some thoughts on what I'd like to add to the current (new) site:

* Plugin that lets you tweak content based on Google Analytics data: http://www.developmentseed.org/blog/google-analytics-jekyll-plugin/

* Would like some form of image gallery. Something that can pull
up images -- maybe from _data files?

* need to modify deployment so that I'm not always updating large files
    * /files
    * /logos
    * /assets
    * should these be over on media.XXX?
    
* Pay attention to projects in the destination
    * CampusCrush
    * Shawn-Sk8r
    * pwht
    * ...
