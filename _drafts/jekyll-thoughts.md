Here are some thoughts on what I'd like to add to the current (new) site:

* Plugin that lets you tweak content based on Google Analytics data: http://www.developmentseed.org/blog/google-analytics-jekyll-plugin/

* Would like some form of image gallery. Something that can pull
up images -- maybe from _data files?
