> As a project drags on, my git commit messages get less and less informative

This is the premise of [Chris Beams](http://chris.beams.io)'s August 2014 blog post [How to Write a Git Commit Message]i(https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) and it's worth reading. It speaks to the many problems I have with my own commit messages and offers up seven rules for changing your bad habits and making you a better collaborator.

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6. Wrap the body ay 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain *what* and *why* vs. *how*

Chris took these from several other places but presents them here in a very well thought out blog/article with examples.

Worth the read, and re-read a few cycles later.
