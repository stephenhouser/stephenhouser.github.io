    A list of reading materials that I have gathered over the years.
    Helpful background material for my classes and projects.
    This would be a good place to start your Technology reading

Often students and colleagues ask "_where do I learn that?_", or "_where is a
good place to start learning..._" To answer those questions, this page collects
a variety of materials that have been useful to me over the years as reference,
as learning materials, and to keep up to date with current practices in
software, electronics, and the things I'm interested in. This is the 2021
revised version.

## Top 10 Technology (Computer) Books

These are the books I would suggest you get a copy of and read cover to cover.
They range from hard-core code to interfacing with the end user and include some
physical (meaning hardware) titles. Later on there is a selection of other
helpful resources, but these are the ones you cannot do without.

1. <img alt="The Art of Readable Code" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51vnhzxNDaL.jpg" style="width:111px; height: 140px; float:right;"/>
    _[The Art of Readable Code: Simple and Practical Techniques for Writing Better Code](https://amzn.to/3tBCrzH)_ by Dustin Boswell and Trevor Foucher.

    This replaces my previous number one pick. It is up-to-date with recent
    languages and techniques. Though I don't agree with all of them
    (specifically class member variable naming with a trailing underscore) and
    the sample code often violates some of their guidelines, the advice is
    solid. In fact, the key ideas should be written on a 3x5 card, laminated,
    and kept in every developers pocket! If you forget to do that, at least
    remember, "Code should be easy to understand."

2. _[Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship](https://amzn.to/3r4oDfv)_ by Robert C. Martin.

    This is a very practical, biased, and proscriptive approach. That should not
    dissuade you though as it is more often than not spot-on in their methods.
    It is a key work in the line of clean, effective, code-writing books that
    are often missing from curriculum and teaching of Computer Science. *Not
    missing any longer as I'm using it for a course in the _Art and Craft of
    Software Development_ in the Spring of 2021!*
    
3. _[Code Complete: A Practical Handbook of Software Construction, Second Edition](https://amzn.to/3cRTjvt)_ by Steve McConnell.

    Code Complete should be on your book shelf and well dog-eared. It's getting
    a bit dated but still holds a wealth of information for developers and it
    still gets a strong recommendation. For a long time this has been better
    than any other code-writing book I had ever read, seen, or heard about. I
    still say, "Buy it, read it completely."

4. _[Writing Solid Code (20th Anniversary 2nd Edition)](https://amzn.to/2OGPbXe)_ by Steve Maguire.

    Yes it is from the dark empire, but they got to be the dark empire
    by writing a lot of code. Perhaps dated in using C and not Java,
    C%2B%2B, or Python, but still very applicable.

5. _[Mythical Man-Month, The: Essays on Software Engineering, Anniversary Edition](https://amzn.to/3lzotf8)_ by Frederick P. Brooks.

    There is a new "anniversary edition" out, I have read the original not the
    new one. Beautifully explains that throwing more people at a project does
    not make it develop faster. Easily number three on the list. Short and sweet
    as well.

6. _[UNIX Network Programming](https://amzn.to/3vGkAcS)_ by W. Richard Stevens.

    This book has been split into two books in the most recent revision. I have
    not read the new ones, but I hear good things. My original is falling apart
    at the binding from overuse. The examples are wonderful starting points for
    any network-based system.

7. _[The Pragmatic Programmer: Your Journey To Mastery, 20th Anniversary Edition (2nd Edition)](https://amzn.to/30VRDv9)_ by David Thomans and Andrew Hunt

    I've only given this one read and letting it sink in before I move it
    further up my top 10 list. I really like the ideas and how they express them
    in a very practical way.

8. _[Design of the UNIX Operating System](https://amzn.to/3lvQrIm)_ by Marice J. Bach, Maurice Bach.

    If UNIX, Linux, or variant is your game this is your book. Describes in
    detail the decisions made in development of the BSD UNIX operating system.

9. _[Modern Operating Systems](https://amzn.to/30Y1lxf)_ by Andrew S. Tanenbaum.

    Before Linux there was Minix, a more modular well-built operating system for
    teaching operating system courses. This book details the concepts and the
    source code for Minix. Perhaps my favorite applied operating system book.

10. _[Compilers : Principles, Techniques, and Tools](https://amzn.to/310kOxa)_ by Alfred V. Aho, Ravi Sethi, Jeffrey D. Ullman.

    The dragon book. You never think you will be writing a compiler, but you
    never know. The techniques on parsing and symbol table maintenance are
    applicable to many other aspects of software development.

11. _[Database Systems: A Practical Approach to Design, Implementation, and Management](https://amzn.to/3s3xIGM)_, by Thomas M. Connolly, Carolyn E. Begg, Carolyn Begg.

    The best database book I have found. Yes even makes those Microsoft Access
    people happy.

## Top Periodicals

My magazine subscriptions have somewhat passed in the last year, so I will not
rate them like I did with books. These however are magazines I regularly read
soon after they arrive in my box.

* _[C/C++ Users Journal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/C%2B%2B_Users_Journal)_

    An old fashioned C programmers dream. Nice code examples, sometimes funny
    editorials. They cover a nice range of topics.

* _[MSDN Magazine](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/)_

    Yes Virginia, another [dark empire](https://microsoft.com) link. For
    [Windows](http://www.windows.com) development, you cannot beat the word of
    the [evil lord](http://www.microsoft.com/billgates/default.asp). This is
    also an excellent magazine, regardless of the ties.

* _Java Pro_ (defunct)

    Great magazine for Java17 developers. Very timely articles on progress in
    Java17.

* _[MacTech](http://mactech.com/)_

    Old timer apple people will know this one. I especially love the
    [Programmers Challenge](http://www.mactech.com) each month. Yes, this one is
    geared to [Macintosh](http://www.apple.com) programmers, but you should
    always know all the angles!

* _[Software Development](http://www.sdmagazine.com/)_

    Used to be Computer Language. A very nice magazine that explores the design,
    management, and architecting of software rather than the development of it.

* _[Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/oramag/) If you develop for [Oracle](http://oracle.com)_ this is their magazine.

    I find it is full of marketing junk, with the exception of one or two
    actually technical articles on managing an Oracle database.

* _[WebTechniques](http://webtechniques.com/)_

    Wonderful magazine for web developers. Often includes articles on
    [Apache](http://www.apache.org), [Perl](http://www.perl.org), and other web
    scripting/development topics.

* _[Dr. Dobbs Journal](http://www.drdobbs.com)_

    They had been the cat's meow for a long time. A few years ago, they got a
    little off for me and I let my subscription lapse. Perhaps it's time to
    reconsider.

## Other Items of Interest

So what about all the other stuff? Well there are plenty of items that did not
make the top lists that are still very useful, not to mention very fun. Here is
a collection of items you should investigate if they peak your interest.

* _[ARRL Handbook](https://amzn.to/2Qi6azj)_

    No amateur radio person would be complete without knowing about the
    [American Radio Relay League](http://www.arrl.org) Their publications are
    second to none in the areas of radio (wireless) systems. This is definitely
    a hardware hackers item. In 2021 this became a six volume set.

* _[New Hackers Dictionary](http://www.mitpress.mit.edu/)_ or similarly called [Jargon](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/) file.

    If you ever wondered where a geek term came from. This is the official
    source, if there can be one.

* _[The Art of Computer Programming, Volumes 1-4A Boxed Set](https://amzn.to/3tHeBTn)_, by Donald E. Knuth.

    The _computer scientist_in me forces me to put this landmark, comprehensive
    set of books on the list somewhere. If it is algorithim it is Knuth.

* _[Algorithms in C, Parts 1-5: Fundamentals, Data Structures, Sorting, Searching, and Graph Algorithms](https://amzn.to/311kOgB)_ by Robert Sedgewick

    An oldie but goody. I understand there is a Java version now.

* _[GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid](https://amzn.to/3tvOEWC)_ by Douglas R. Hofstadter.

    O.k. this may not _technically_be a software/computer book, but the essence
    of and recursiveness in the book applies itself to many computer problems.
    Besides, if you make it through this book, and understand half of it, you
    will be admired by all who know it. A former top 10 book for me.

* [O'Riley Publishing](http://www.oreilly.com/)

    Perhaps the number one publisher of good UNIX and practical books I know of.
    Especially their series on [Perl](http://perl.org).

* _[Java Look and Feel Design Guidelines](http://java.sun.com/products/jlf/ed1/guidelines.html)_

    An excellent book, easily extended to programming languages other than Java,
    for developing graphical user interfaces.

* _[The Unix Operating System](https://amzn.to/2OP0RqL)_ by Kaare Christian, Susan Richter.

    My favorite intro to UNIX book. Used in my COS 212 UNIX Operating System
    classes.


* _[Computer Networks and Internets (6th Edition)](https://amzn.to/3eWTCYA)_ by Douglas E. Comer, Ralph E. Droms.

    Another networking book with a new version out. Much more detailed about the
    protocols and less on programming applications. Perfect for network
    engineers and developers needing to understand the lower layers of the
    network model. A former top 10 book for me.

* _[Applying UML and Patterns](https://amzn.to/3r2Bpv0)_ by Craig Larman.

    I have gone mostly through the abbreviated CD/video version as well -- got
    bored. Text has many good points but is often too dragged into details.
    Repetitive -- as is the iterative cycle pushed in the book. Good reading and
    reference regardless, length just not needed.

* _[Core J2Ee Patterns: Best Practices and Design Strategies](https://amzn.to/38V5GFG)_

    Tells you what you will learn, learns you, tells you what you learned, then
    repeats three or four more times. The introduction to patterns and the
    pattern library are essential. There are parts in the middle I could have
    done without. makes me wonder which patterns Sun is pushing though Home ==
    Factory!?

* _[Art of Java Web Development: Struts, Tapestry, Commons, Velocity, JUnit, Axis, Cocoon, InternetBeans, WebWork](https://amzn.to/2QdoYj8)_ by Neal Ford.

    An excellent diganosis of Java web development. I love his approach in
    leading you down the path to Model 2 and Model-View-Controller applications
    from an application that you think is flexible already. Every
    Java/JSP/Servlet web developer should give this a good read. One down fall
    is that it gets to web frameworks, but does not quite give enough
    information to use them. Regardless this book is an excellent overview.

* _[Programming and Customizing PIC Microcontrollers](https://amzn.to/2QpYz1X)_, by Myke Predko.

    This is not only a great book on the [Microchip](http://microchip.com) 
    [PIC Microcontroller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIC_microcontroller), it
    is an excellent hardware book. There are many interface circuits and general
    purpose ideas that are incredibly useful. This is my first reference for
    hardware projects.

* _[Head First Design Patterns: A Brain-Friendly Guide](https://amzn.to/30VSegD)_, by Brian Bates, Kathy Sierra, and Elisabeth Robson.

    The whole _Head First_ series seems really, really good. I'm intrigued to
    read the newer [Head First Python: A Brain-Friendly
    Guide](https://amzn.to/3vGtdE5) as I'm developing more in Python these days.

## Final Notes

I hope that this reading list has given you some ideas and places to start
researching more computer, software, and hardware topics. In the future we will
refer back to parts of many of these books, magazines, and other items as backup
material.

Until then, "_So long and thanks for all the fish._" (_Hitchhikers Guide to the
Galaxy Trilogy_ by Douglas Adams)
