description: Buildathon for QSO Today Ham Expo (Spring 2023)

---
As part of the [QSO Today Ham Expo](https://www.qsotodayhamexpo.com/) this spring where we are building a 40m transceiver we are adding a little extra "Internet" to the project. A log and map of builders and contacts! We are building the [Sea Sprite+](http://qrpme.com/?p=product&id=QSO9) from [QRPme](http://qrpme.com). Hope to see you there!

<blockquote>
    Rex Harper, WIREX, returns to the QSO Today Virtual Ham Expo on Saturday March 25th at 10:00 AM PDT or 1800 UTC with his live build-a-thon, "Build A Simple Station and GOTA (Get On The Air!), where he will build, with his audience, a simple 40 meter transceiver kit, available from Rex's kit company, QRP-ME. Once the transceivers are built, the builders will attempt to contact each other on the air that afternoon. A follow-up on Sunday, March 26th, called "We all GOTA-ed.â€¦So what happened? What worked and what didn't? A wrap up... will finish off the weekend's build-a-thon.
