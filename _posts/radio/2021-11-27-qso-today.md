Eric Guth (4Z1UG) interviewed me on his [QSO Today Podcast](https://www.qsotoday.com/podcasts/N1SH). We talked a bit about how I got started in Amatuer (Ham) Radio, what fun projects I've worked on, and a few other random things.

Here's the blurb from his posting on the interview:

<blockquote>
    Stephen Houser, N1SH, was essential to helping Rex Harper, W1REX, present his Build-A-Thons at the QSO Today Virtual Ham Expos with multi-camera coverage of Rexâ€™s project demonstrations.  Stephen had early exposure to amateur radio and  was no stranger to our hobby years before he got his first license. Stephen has a strong interest and expertise in computers, programming, building projects, and he makes his own contributions to our interesting hobby. N1SH is my QSO Today.
