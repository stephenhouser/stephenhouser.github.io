[YouTube live stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08y0yRGPq2s&t=9s) with [Kyle AA0Z](https://www.youtube.com/@AA0Z) walking through the Node Red [WSJT-X nodes](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-wsjt-x) for [Node Red](https://flows.nodered.org).

An hour of talking with Kyle and his viewers about the NodeRed nodes to interact with WSJT-X over the network. We start really basic with a simple NodeRed _flow_. We work into setting up WSJT-X to send data out over the network and capture it in NodeRed with a _UDP_ node. Then we drop in the WSJT-X nodes and are able to decode the data and develop more complex actions.

The stream shows how to build a simple flow and decode traffic, how to import some of the example flows, how to build on them, and finally how to control WSJT-X over the network from NodeRed.

Thanks Kyle for the oppurtunity to give an introduction and to the great folks over on [Groups.io/nodered-hamradio](https://groups.io/g/nodered-hamradio) who have been testing and building on these nodes over the past few years!
