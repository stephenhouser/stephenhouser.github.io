description: Buildathon for QSO Today Ham Expo (Spring 2023)

---
As part of the QSO Today Ham Expo this spring where we are building a 40m transceiver we are adding a little extra "Internet" to the project. A log and map of builders and contacts!

- [Google Sheet of Builders and Contacts](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D5R-rveW2zztQAyE6ZprIlaryfo-Mc3ILt1jF31jO1E/edit#gid=0)
- [Map of Kit Builders and Contacts](https://stephenhouser.com/qso-mapper/qso-today.html)

First we have a [Google Spreadsheet of Builders and Contacts](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D5R-rveW2zztQAyE6ZprIlaryfo-Mc3ILt1jF31jO1E/edit#gid=0) where builders can enter in their building location

The build locations and contacts will also be showin on our [Map of Kit Builders and Contacts](https://stephenhouser.com/qso-mapper/qso-today.html) as more folks enter in their information and make contacts during the expo!


Enjoy the weekend of Hamming!
