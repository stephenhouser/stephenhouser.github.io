For the past few months I've been working on a set of "nodes" for the flow based programming tool [NodeRed](https://nodered.org) to control and monitor [Flexradio 6xxx series](https://www.flexradio.com) radios. Today marks the release of version 1.0, the first general release version. I'm still in the process of writing up more extensive project documentation, so this article will serve to mark the release and give some pointers to places for more details including some tutorial videos on YouTube.

A big THANK YOU to Dave W02X, Alan WA9WUD, Gary K6HN, Warren KD4Z, Mike K5MAP, and all the other members of [nodered-hamradio on groups.io](](https://groups.io/g/nodered-hamradio)) that have helped in making these nodes possible. Thier tireless reworking and adapting their existing flows and setup to use these nodes, testing them with their varied equipment, and encouragement have really been instrumental in getting to a usable set of nodes.
