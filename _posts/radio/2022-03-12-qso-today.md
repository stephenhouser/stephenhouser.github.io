[Rex Harper (w1rex)](http://qrpme.com) and I hosted two kit building sessions at the [March 2022 QSO Today Virtual Ham Expo](https://www.qsotodayhamexpo.com/mar21home.html). Rex did most of the talking and showing, I was more the camera operator, chat-upkeep, and support. It was a blast. Both sessions were recorded and they are available on YouTube and Vimeo.
