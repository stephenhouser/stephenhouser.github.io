I managed to make contact with the "rarest of the rare" remote locations for amateur radio
operators this morning, [K1N][k1n], on [Navassa Island][wiki]. It's a tiny place between 
Hati, Cuba, and Jamacia. It is administered by the US, but remains disputed between the US
and Hati.

From the news and the [K1N website][k1n], I knew they would be on the radio today. 
I was hoping they  would be on <code>20m upper sideband (USB)</code> and I was in luck! 
At <code>2015-02-07 15:35 UTC</code> I made a brief <code>5x9</code> QSO with 
the 2015 Navassa DXpedition among the huge pileup of others across the world.

Now I can sit back and wait for the QSL card and the ARRL LoTW entry. Good luck to the
other folks out there trying to get a QSO with them.
