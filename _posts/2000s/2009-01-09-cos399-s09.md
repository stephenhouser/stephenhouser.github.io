Introduction to the programming concepts involved with autonomous
robotic systems. Using off the shelf robot kits students will design a
simple robotic platform to meet specific goals. Then, using a common
platform for the remainder of the course, students will develop their
programming capabilities. Simple open-ended, feedback, and artifial
intelligence systems will be explored throughout the. Several benchmarks
and robot competitions will be used demonstrate the platform and
programming learned in the course.
