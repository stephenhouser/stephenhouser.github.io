This release brings compatibility with iOS 6. Specifically the maps
integration and how turns are submitted to the Good Turn Web. Good turns
are no longer identified by a phone's UDID but instead a new privacy
enhanced mechanism provided by Apple's SDK.

The [Good Turn][GoodTurnApp] application is a simple yet hi-tech
replacement for the age-old good turn coin carried by many scouts to
remind them to "Do a good turn daily." It was primarily designed for the
iPhone and iPod touch. It works on the iPad in the double-size mode. The
fully functional application is free of charge. Additional in-app
purchases provide different stylized coins, bronze, silver, and gold,
for flipping each time a good turn is done. The cost of these goes
towards keeping the web companion site running, future development, and
most importantly supporting our local [Boy Scouts][Troop349] and [Cub
Scouts][Pack349].
