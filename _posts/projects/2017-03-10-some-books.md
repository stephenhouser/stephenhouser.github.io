A small, lightweight, system for keeping tack of the books we (the Southern Maine
Men's Book club) have read over the years. It's a substibute for sites like
[Google Groups](http://groups.google.com) and [GoodReads](http://goodreads.com)
that we used for a while. Built using some very basic JavaScript with 
[jQuery](https://jquery.com/) and a few add-ons, like 
[data tables](https://datatables.net/).
