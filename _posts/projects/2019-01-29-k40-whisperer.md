Packaging of [Scorchworks K40 Whisperer](http://www.scorchworks.com/K40whisperer/k40whisperer.html) as an macOS Application. The official K40 Whisperer and instructions are at [Scorchworks K40 Whisperer](http://www.scorchworks.com/K40whisperer/k40whisperer.html). This fork is merely to add packaging for macOS systems, creating a clickable 'Applicaion' that can be installed on any macOS system. This eliminates having to run K40 Whisperer from a Terminal prompt. 
> K40 Whisperer is an alternative to the the Laser Draw (LaserDRW) program that comes with the cheap Chinese laser cutters available on E-Bay and Amazon. K40 Whisperer reads SVG and DXF files, interprets the data and sends commands to the K40 controller to move the laser head and control the laser accordingly. K40 Whisperer does not require a USB key (dongle) to function."
