A listing of board games I own or have played in a nicely laid out, sortable and searchable table. The play data is extracted from [boardgamegeek.com](https://boardgamegeek.com) (XMLAPI2) on the fly and supplemented with local (XML) data for games that have not been published or are not listed there. Built using [Bootstrap v5](https://getbootstrap.com), JavaScript, minimal [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), like [data tables](https://datatables.net/) (now cloudtables).
