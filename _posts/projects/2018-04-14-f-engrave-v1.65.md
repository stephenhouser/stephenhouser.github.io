Packaged up an update to [Scorchworks F-Engrave](http://www.scorchworks.com/Fengrave/fengrave.html) GCODE generator for macOS. It has been a few versions since I updated the package so there was a bit of overhead in getting things set up and working again. I also took the time to clean up the build and update scripts that I use to make the package. One of those, "leave it better than you found it" moments. Perhaps my future-self with thank my current self for the extra work.

The updated release can be found on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/stephenhouser/f-engrave/releases)
