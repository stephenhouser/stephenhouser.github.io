A <a href="http://www.livescribe.com/en-us/">Livescribe Pulse Smartpen</a>
application that implements a simple countdown timer. The pen itself has
several applications for recording written notes and audio. Many users
had requested a countdown timer application even before Livescribe
released a development kit for the pen. This application was also
entered in the <a
href="http://www.facebook.com/livescribe#!/livescribe?v=app_194322499426
">Livescribe Developer Challenge</a>.

Applications for the pen are written in <a
href="http://java.sun.com">Java</a>, specifically the <a
href="http://java.sun.com/javame">Java Platform, Micro Edition
(J2ME)</a>. The <a href="http://livescribe.com/developer">Developer
SDK</a> for the pen captures the essence of the pen's functions. It
provides for applications to be launched from the pen's menu system or
from previously captured marks on the special Anoto dot-paper. There is
a small community of developers working on applications for the pen's
new <a href="http://www.livescribe.com/en-us/">Application Store</a> (in
beta as of this writing).

The <b>Pen Timer Free</b> application is a simple countdown timer. It
can be used in man situations, like setting time limits in meetings or
short-term reminders. This version, intended to be a free version with a
paid version to follow, has limited features. The initial starting times
are selected from the application menu. The starting times are limited
to 5, 10, 15, and 30 seconds or 1, 5, 10, 15, and 30 minutes or 1 hour.
In addition the alarm that sounds when the timer expires is configurable
from a set of pre-loaded sounds. Similarly a 5, 2, and 1 minute warning
sound can be configured from the same set of sounds.

The not-released paid version will (would) allow creation of timer
regions on the dot-paper. These regions are drawn and configured with
alarm and warning sounds as well as an initial time. When reactivated
they immediately begin their countdown. This mode allows you to
preconfigure timers for later, quick, use.

## The Code
I am still considering how to release the code. So you will just have to
enjoy the screenshots here, the <a

see me in person to get a live demo.
