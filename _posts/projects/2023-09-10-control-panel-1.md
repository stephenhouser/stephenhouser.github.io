An old-school toggle-switch control panel for Home Automation. I've fast grown tired
of tablet interfaces and flat glass screens you have to type on. This is my retaliation,
a very tactile control panel for home automation. The control panel interfaces with
my home automation system to control lights and devices around my house. The best part
is I can "feel" the switches in the dark to turn on the lights!
