Somehow I've started building speakers. They combine electronics with woodworking all in one nice sounding box! I settled on Paul Carmody's Overnight Sensations as my first go. Thus far I'be built two sets of the bookshelf speakers and am in the process of building the floorstanding "TMM" and center channel speakers. The full CAD drawings and PCB board files are included in the project!
