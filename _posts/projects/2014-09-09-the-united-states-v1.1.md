An updated version of The United States iPad app was released that
includes changes to the user interface to make it feel more at home on
iOS 7. There were changes to colors and the style of the user interface.
Also, corrected a spelling error or two!


This update still maintains compatibility with iOS 6 devices and should
run on all iPad models.
