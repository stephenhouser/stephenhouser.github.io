A compact browser based application to show Amateur Radio QSOs on an interactive map and table. Does not require any desktop installation. You can either upload an [ADIF](http//adif.org) file through your web browser or give the application a URL to load a web-accessible [ADIF](http//adif.org) file and generate a link you can share your log with others. Written in [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com) using [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com) and [Open Street Map](https://www.openstreetmap.org/).
