A set of "nodes" for the flow based programming tool [NodeRed](https://nodered.org) that connect to, control, and monitor [Flexradio 6xxx series](https://www.flexradio.com) radios. With these nodes you can inject data from the radio into your flows (programs) and combine it with other data and then send commands to the radio, changing frequency, settings, and just about anything on the radio.

A big THANK YOU to Dave W02X, Alan WA9WUD, Gary K6HN, Warren KD4Z, Mike K5MAP, and all the other members of [nodered-hamradio on groups.io](](https://groups.io/g/nodered-hamradio)) that have helped in making these nodes possible. Thier tireless reworking and adapting their existing flows and setup to use these nodes, testing them with their varied equipment, and encouragement have really been instrumental in getting to a usable set of nodes.
