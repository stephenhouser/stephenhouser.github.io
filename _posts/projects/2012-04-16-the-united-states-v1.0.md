My latest product, [The United States for iPad][appstore] hit the App Store
just in time for Patriot's Day (April 16th) 2012!


[![The United States][screenshot]][appstore]

[The United States][appstore] is an educational application designed to help
K-5 students learn their United States geography. It was originally
envisioned by my son after many interruptions from my daughter asking
where a particular state was on the map. Developed by me over several
months and play tested by my daughter. Now that all our family members
are experts at identifying the states of the Union, it's your turn.

There are two main aspects of the application; an interactive map and
several games based on state facts. Each has a lot to explore and each
was a blast to put together.

The interactive map allows you to tap on any state and show its name and
a small version of the state flag. If you continue further and tap on
the name (in a button) the application will reveal a full screen of
information about the state. Centered around a web-view of theWikipedia
page about the state, this view lets you learn some pertinent and fun
state facts.

The games are accessed from a popup menu on the interactive map.
Currently there are several games; some of which are easy and others
quite difficult. Name the State is the most basic of the games. When you
begin, a state flips out of the blank map into the center of the screen.
You are given three possible state names and are asked to identify which
state is shown. Find the State is the next style of game. In this game
you must find the named state on the map by tapping on it. Each of the
following games is in one of these two styles but with more difficult
state information.

Much of the information for the facts and games were gathered from
Wikipedia and other web sites, including those of the states themselves.
All the data was combined into attributes in an SVG file, also
originally from Wikipedia.
