An implementation of John Conway's cellular automota know as Life. The application was originally done as an example and project for a Java Programming class I taught (quite a while ago now). I never assigned this one for homework or anything, but it was interesting and a good use of many of Java's features. Of course it is based on John Conway's Life game from Scientific American.
