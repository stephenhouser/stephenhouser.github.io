A native iPhone calculator application. The interface is based on the
distributed iPhone calculator application. The goal was to cplay around
with iPhone development It is really a base to flesh out the basic
functionality and a platform to build more on, if I have time.
Available on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/iphcalc/">Google Code</a>.


This was built on an original iPhone with the "development toolchain,"
well before Apple allowed for native application development.
