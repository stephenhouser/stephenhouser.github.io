A set of "nodes" for the flow based programming tool [NodeRed](https://nodered.org) that connect to, control, and monitor [WSJT-X](https://wsjt.sourceforge.io/wsjtx.html) software over the network.

A big THANK YOU to Dave W02X, Alan WA9WUD, Adrian VK4TUX, and all the other members of [nodered-hamradio on groups.io](](https://groups.io/g/nodered-hamradio)) that have helped in making these nodes possible. Thier tireless reworking and adapting their existing flows and setup to use these nodes, testing them with their varied equipment, and encouragement have really been instrumental in getting to a usable set of nodes.
