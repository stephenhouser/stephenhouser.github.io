Today iOS version of the [Portland Women's History Trail][2]
went live in the [Apple AppStore][applestore].


The [web version][4] has been live for some time. The [Android version][googlestore]
went live just over a week ago. Now, the final version is live for iOS users
to find easily in the [Apple AppStore][applestore].

The trail was originally created by [Eileen Eagan][1] and Polly Welts Kaufman
in Portland (Maine). The app is built using [jQuery Mobile][3] and
[jekyll][5] to create a complete HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript application. To read more
