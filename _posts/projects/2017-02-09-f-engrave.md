Packaging of [Scorchworks F-Engrave](http://www.scorchworks.com/Fengrave/fengrave.html) as an macOS Application. F-Engrave generates 'GCODE' for Computer Numerical Control (CNC) systems from text and bitmaps. It "Supports Engraving and V-Carving, Uses CXF and TTF fonts, Imports DXF and Bitmap images". The official F-Engrave and instructions are at [Scorchworks](http://www.scorchworks.com/Fengrave/fengrave.html). This fork is merely to add packaging for macOS systems, creating a clickable 'Application' that can be installed on any macOS system. This eliminates having to run F-Engrave from a Terminal prompt.
