An interactive audio controller app that mimics the 17-foot interactive
tower as part of [Architalx's][architalx] 25th anniversary exhibit,
"_Voices of Design: 25 Years of Architalx_." At the [Portland Museum of
Art][pma] from February 2nd through May 19th, 2013. In collaboration
with [Raphael DiLuzio][raphael] and [Matthias Oostrik][matthias]. The
iPad app controls the audio portals and allows visitors to listen to
snippets of audio from past lectures on architecture by visiting
architects.

### The Code
I am still considering if and how to release the code. So you will just
have to enjoy the screenshots and video here or see me in person to get
a live demo.
