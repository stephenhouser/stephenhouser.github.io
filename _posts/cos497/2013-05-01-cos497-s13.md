This course is an independent study that will largely follow the
[Stanford CS193P -- Coding Together: Developing Apps for iPhone and
iPad][cs193p] course materials through a 12-14 week time period
developing expertise in Apple iOS mobile device application development.


During the summer of 2013 we will also have a few students doing the
same assignments with the Android OS, following the work of [Stanford's
CS193A -- Android Programming][cs193a] course. The Android work will be
a bit more time-intensive as there is not a set of pre-canned lectures
like the Stanford videos.

##  Organizational Meeting
We will behaving an organizational meeting to review the scope of what
we hope to accomplish, the time line of our summer, and to introduce
each other. Future meetings will be a combination of on-campus and via
[Google Chat][gtalk].
