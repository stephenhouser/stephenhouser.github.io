Introduction to the programming concepts involved with autonomous robotic systems. Using off the shelf robot kits students will design a simple robotic platform to meet specific goals. Then, using a common platform for the remainder of the course, students will develop their programming capabilities. Simple open-ended, feedback, and artifial intelligence systems will be explored throughout the. Several benchmarks and robot competitions will be used demonstrate the platform and programming learned in the course.
