A simple yet hi-tech replacement for the age-old good turn coin carried by many scouts to remind them to "Do a good turn daily." It is quick and easy to use; just swipe or double-tap to flip the coin on the screen each day when your good turn has been done. The application shows you have done your good turn for the day, and records the date, time, and location for later reference.
