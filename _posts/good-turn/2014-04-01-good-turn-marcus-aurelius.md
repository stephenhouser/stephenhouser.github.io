> Such There Be, Who when They Have Done a Good Turn to Any,
> Are Ready to set them on the score for it, and to require
> retaliation. Others there be, who though they stand not
> upon retaliation, to require any, yet they think with themselves
> nevertheless, that such a one is their debtor, and they know as
> their word is what they have done. Others again there be, who when
> they have done any such thing, do not so much as know what they have
> done; but are like unto the vine, which beareth her grapes, and
> when once she hath borne her own proper fruit, is contented and
> seeks for no further recompense.
