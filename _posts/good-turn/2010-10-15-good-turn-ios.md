The [Good Turn][GoodTurnApp] application is a simple yet hi-tech
replacement for the age-old good turn coin carried by many scouts to
remind them to "Do a good turn daily." It was primarily designed for the
iPhone and iPod touch. It works on the iPad in the double-size mode. The
fully functional application is free of charge. Additional in-app
purchases provide different stylized coins, bronze, silver, and gold,
for flipping each time a good turn is done. The cost of these goes
towards keeping the web companion site running, future development, and
most importantly supporting our local [Boy Scouts][Troop349] and [Cub
Scouts][Pack349].

In addition to the phone app, the [Good Turn Web][GoodTurnWeb] companion
site provides a view from any web browser to the good turns that people
are doing all over the world. You can navigate around a dynamic [Google
Map][GoogleMaps] with markers on recent good turn locations. The site
also provides support information for the application.
