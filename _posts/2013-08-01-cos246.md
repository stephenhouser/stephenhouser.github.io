An introductory level course that focuses on evaluating, designing, developing, and deploying applications for mobile and particularly handheld devices. The course will cover aspects of Apple's iOS, Google's Android, and HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript for building applications. We will pay special attention to environments that require little or no programming. Where we must resort to programming, we will look for cross-platform solutions.
