It was a few weeks ago that I found I might need to travel around the
state for work, visiting many towns of Maine from Wells to Fort
Kent. At the time I was also reading [Zen and the Art of Motorcycle
Maintenance][1] and thought, how fun it would be to travel by bike or
motorcycle across Maine in the summer. Out in the air, experiencing
summer.  Well, one thing led to another and here I am working on
fixing up the 1982 London Roadster that has sat in my garage since
2005 when I took the engine out and apart.

My first thought was a nice [Ural][2] with a sidecar would be a
wonderful bike, with some storage room and good visibility to cars on
the road. At $14k, it was a little out of my price range â€“ and never
having ridden a motorcycle for an extended period of time, perhaps not
the best choice. I began looking at some super-scooters that might get
the job done. These are quite beefy, up to 250cc. Not your average
moped. Could be fun. This of course all led to the convertible sitting
in the garage. Which would be just as fun to ride and there she was.

On a whim, while looking at scooters and motorcycles, I searched
cragislist for VW engines. Gulp. There was one for $750 in
Raymond. That's worth a look. Only 20 miles or less form my house. Two
days later, I loaded it up in the truck and drove it home. On the
surface it looks good, I'm hoping the insides are working as
advertised as well. I'm not a real expert on engines (yet) and hope
I've at least not wasted all $750 of my purchase price. The motor has
sat, in its assembled state for several years, the fellow said it ran
very smooth when he purchased it some time ago. Here's hoping that's
all true and that when installed, she will purr like a kitten.

And that's where my daughter enters the picture. Pondering that the
roadster, after being in my possession longer than many other things
in my life, does not have a name. So is the birth of "Kit Cat." It's a
combination of kit-car and my daughters first love, cats. So far the
name has stuck. I've read some other names online that are appealing,
like Bridget the Midget, but we will stick to Kit Cat for now and see
how she wears it.

Fortunately over the years Kit Cat was collecting mostly dust. I'm
pretty good at not stacking things in and around other things in the
garage. The garage is for cars, not for storage. Unfortunately, I have
discovered over the past few weeks she has been collecting problems
from just sitting doing nothing. Cars like to be driven. She has not
been driven and she is happily reminding me of that when I poke and
prod at her innards. No worries Kit, we are getting you fixed up this
time around.
