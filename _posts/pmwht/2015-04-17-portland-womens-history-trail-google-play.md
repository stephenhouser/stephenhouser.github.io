went live in the [Google play][googlestore].

The [web version][4] has been live for some time and the iOS version is currently
waiting for review by Apple.

The trail was originally created by [Eileen Eagan][1] and Polly Welts Kaufman
in Portland (Maine). The app is built using [jQuery Mobile][3] and
[jekyll][5] to create a complete HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript application. To read more
about the application, check the related posts below.

Here's a few screenshots to whet your appetite:
