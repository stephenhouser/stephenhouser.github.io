Today version 1.1 of the [Portland Women's History Trail][2] went live in the
[Apple AppStore][applestore], the [Google play][googlestore], and on the [web][4].

The march to version 1.1 took quite a bit of time, most of which was finding
and getting use rights for some historic photos. We also worked to include
new, professional, photos of most of the sites. In the process we weeded out
some of our less appealing photos.


There was also a little external pressure as the version of [Cordova][cordova]
used in v1.0 had some exploits discovered. Google gave developers until May
9th, 2016 to update their apps or be pulled from the [Google play store][googlestore]. This actually helped put a deadline on the release of v1.1.
