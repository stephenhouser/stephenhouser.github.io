John Muthyala had a very nice article published in [EDUCAUSE Review](https://er.educause.edu/articles/2020/6/digital-innovation-in-the-liberal-arts) that features our work on the Portland Women's History Trail.

It's nice to see the publicity for the app. It does however need a little love after a few years of being somewhat dormant. You can find the app in the Apple app store, Google Play store, or just take a look at the online web-version.

More details on the project are on the [Portland Women's Histry Trail](/pmwht/) project page.
