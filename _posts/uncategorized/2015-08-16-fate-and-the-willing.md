> Lead me, Master of the soaring vault   
> Of Heaven, lead me, Father, where you will.   
> I stand here prompt and eager to obey.   
> And ev'n suppose I were unwilling, still   
> I should attend you and know suffering,   
> Dishonourably and grumbling, when I might   
> Have done so and been good as well. For Fate   
> The willing leads, the unwilling drags along.   

-- Cicero (via Seneca)

Also quoted as:
