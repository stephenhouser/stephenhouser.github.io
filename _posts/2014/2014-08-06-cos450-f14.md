This course is a bottom up construction of a layered operating system beginning with the hardware interface and ending with the user interface. Specific topics covered include concurrent processes, process management, I/O, virtual memory, file management, resource scheduling, and performance measurement. Students are assumed to be familiar with general machine architecture, functions of system software (compilers, loaders, editors, etc.), data structures, and to have some experience with UNIX or another multiprogramming operating system.

## About This Semester

Welcome to the <strong>Fall 2014 Operating Systems</strong> course, <strong>COS 450</strong> and <strong>COS 550</strong>. The start of the semester is only a week away which means I'm spending this otherwise very nice day glued to my computer preparing course materials for you. During the first class we will be covering the syllabus and our schedule for the semester. If you are considering adding the course, please be in-class on the first day.

This semester will be quite exciting, we are going to work on several operating system projects in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pintos">Pintos</a> operating system. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pintos">Pintos</a> was designed specifically for operating systems courses. It's small and the code is more easily understood than recent versions of <a href="http://kernel.org/">Linux</a> which we have used in the past. There are three projects and they can be quite difficult. To best prepare yourself, review the materials in the <strong>Resources</strong> section of the course. Specifically make sure you start reading through the <a href="https://ba67fe28c21164a5e01c3b3e6622156135899af2.googledrive.com/host/0B-dNF1GpqqFhdHoyaUNzN0xpQk0/">Pintos Documentation</a>.

## Where's The Stuff?

There are two critical sites associated with the course that you will use frequently:

* <a href="http://goo.gl/5HDUPQ">Course Materials</a>: for schedule, project documentation, reading, and lecture materials.
* <a href="http://www.courses.maine.edu">Blackboard</a>: for project submission, exams, and grades.

Before our first meeting on Tuesday, September 2nd, you should review the <strong>Syllabus</strong> for the course (on the <a href="http://goo.gl/5HDUPQ">Course Materials</a> site). There you will find the schedule, grading, and other information. Also, you should log in to <a href="http://www.courses.maine.edu">Blackboard</a>. There you will find an <strong>Orientation Survey</strong>. Please take a few minutes to fill out the survey. It will help me in making sure you are best equipped to get through the course successfully.

## Cheaper Textbook!

This semester we are using a condensed (less expensive) version of the textbook. <a href="http://codex.cs.yale.edu/avi/os-book/OS8/os8e/index.html"><em>Operating System Concepts Essentials</em></a>, by Silberschatz, Galvin, and Gange. The<a href="http://usm.maine.edu/books"> USM Bookstore</a> should have them in shortly. The Authors' website, <a href="http://codex.cs.yale.edu/avi/os-book/OS8/os8e/index.html">os-book.com</a>, contains some helpful additional materials including a study guide.

Enjoy what time remains of your summer, I'm looking forward to seeing you in class next week.
