Buying a [3D Printer][ultimaker] has been one of the best decisions I've ever made. Not just because I love to make things, but it's sheer usefulness in making things that are otherwise hard to find, obsolete, or where the shipping for a $1.50 part is... lets just say a lot more than you would think.


Last weekend I found myself in that situation. I had ~~lost~~ misplaced<sup>[1](#misplaced)</sup> a small nylon clip that holds the spark plug wires in place on my London Roadster while changing out the distributor. After searching the garage for a disturbingly long time, taking a break, looking online for a replacement, and searching again, I thought to myself, "Self, you have a 3D printer. Someone must have had the same problem already. Maybe someone already made a design." Alas, there were plug wire holders, but none for air cooled VW engines.

I've been using [Autodesk Fusion 360][fusion360] for designing wood CNC projects and have been getting reasonably familiar with it. I did also design an Arduino/RFLink case a few months back. So I broke out the digital calipers and got designing.

Here's what I came up with. The part is available on [Autodesk][f360vwplug] and on [Thingiverse][tversevwplug] if you have a similar problem.

<a name="misplaced">1</a>: I later found the clip "right where I left it" in the boot of the car.
