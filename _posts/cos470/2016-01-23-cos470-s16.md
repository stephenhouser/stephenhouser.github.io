This course is about developing mobile applications.
Students will focus on developing for iOS (Apple) with Swift and Objective-C.
Time will also be spent with cross-platform development in HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript.
The course is heavily project oriented and will rely on students being well
prepared in their reading, research, and development skills.
