The updated version (1.2.0) of The United States iPad app is out! The last release was in 2014 and [Apple](http://apple.com) sent me a message that it was going to be removed from the App Store unless I updated it. I've completed a bit of coding and testing and *poof* it's available.

There are really only a two fixes outside the recompilation and project file updates.

* Update to and tweak an old version of [SVGKit](https://github.com/stephenhouser/SVGKit) used to display the map.
* Changes to the Apple [GameKit](apple gamekit) and how achievements are tracked as the API changed.
