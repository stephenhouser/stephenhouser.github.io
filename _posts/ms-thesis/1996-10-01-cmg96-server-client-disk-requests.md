In this study, we consider the relationship of client IO requests
submitted to a file server and the server's disk subsystem IO traffic.
We collected traces of client-server IOs and, during each trace period,
we also traced server storage subsystem workloads. We analyze and
compare trace pairs collected in each trace period. We evaluate file
server performance and investigate the relationship between client file
requests and server disk workloads.
