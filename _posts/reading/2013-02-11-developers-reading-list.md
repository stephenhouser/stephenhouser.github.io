Often people, students, and colleagues ask "_where did you find that
information_", or "_where is a good place to start doing so and so._" To
answer those questions, this page collects a variety of materials that
have been useful to me over the years as reference, as learning
materials, and to keep up to date with current practice.


## Top 10 Technology (Computer) Books

These are the books I would suggest you get a copy of and read cover to
cover. They range from hard-core code to interfacing with the end user
and include some physical (meaning hardware) titles. Later on there is a
selection of other helpful resources, but these are the ones you cannot
do without.

1. <img alt="The Art of Readable Code" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51vnhzxNDaL.jpg" style="width: 111px; height: 140px; float:right;"/>_[The Art of Readable Code][2]_ by Dustin Boswell and Trevor Foucher.

    This replaces my previous number one pick. It is up-to-date with
    recent languages and techniques. Though I don't agree with all of
    them (specifically class member variable naming with a trailing
    underscore) and the sample code often violates some of their
    guidelines, the advice is solid. In fact, the key ideas should be
    written on a 3x5 card, laminated, and kept in every developers
    pocket! If you forget to do that, at least remember, "Code should be
    easy to understand."

2. _[Code Complete : A Practical Handbook of Software Construction][3]_ by Steve McConnell.

    Code Complete should be on your book shelf and well dog-eared. It's
    getting a bit dated but still holds a wealth of information for
    developers and it still gets a strong recommendation. For a long
    time this has been better than any other code-writing book I had
    ever read, seen, or heard about. I still say, "Buy it, read it
    completely."

3. _[Writing Solid Code : Microsoft's Techniques for Developing Bug-Free C Programs][4]_ by Steve Maguire.

    Yes it is from the dark empire, but they got to be the dark empire
    by writing a lot of code. Perhaps dated in using C and not Java,
    C%2B%2B, or Python, but still very applicable.

4. _[The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering][5]_ by Frederick P. Brooks.

    There is a new "anniversary edition" out, I have read the original
    not the new one. Beautifully explains that throwing more people at a
    project does not make it develop faster. Easily number three on the
    list. Short and sweet as well.

5. _[UNIX Network Programming][6]_ by W. Richard Stevens.

    This book has been split into two books in the most recent revision.
    I have not read the new ones, but I hear good things. My original is
    falling apart at the binding from overuse. The examples are
    wonderful starting points for any network-based system.

6. _[Computer Networks &amp; Internets with Internet Applications][7]_ by Douglas E. Comer, Ralph E. Droms.

    Another networking book with a new version out. Much more detailed
    about the protocols and less on programming applications. Perfect
    for network engineers and developers needing to understand the lower
    layers of the network model.

7. _[Design of the UNIX Operating System][8]_ by Marice J. Bach, Maurice Bach.

    If UNIX, Linux, or variant is your game this is your book. Describes
    in detail the decisions made in development of the BSD UNIX
    operating system.

8. _[Modern Operating Systems][9]_ by Andrew S. Tanenbaum.

    Before Linux there was Minix, a more modular well-built operating
    system for teaching operating system courses. This book details the
    concepts and the source code for Minix. Perhaps my favorite applied
    operating system book.

9. _[Compilers : Principles, Techniques, and Tools][10]_ by Alfred V. Aho, Ravi Sethi, Jeffrey D. Ullman.

    The dragon book. You never think you will be writing a compiler, but
    you never know. The techniques on parsing and symbol table
    maintenance are applicable to many other aspects of software
    development.

10. _Database Systems: A Practical Approach to Design_, Implementation and Management by Thomas M. Connolly, Carolyn E. Begg, Carolyn Begg.

    The best database book I have found. Yes even makes those Microsoft
    Access people happy.

## Top Periodicals

My magazine subscriptions have somewhat passed in the last year, so I
will not rate them like I did with books. These however are magazines I
regularly read soon after they arrive in my box.

* _[C/C++ Users Journal][11]_

    An old fashioned C programmers dream. Nice code examples, sometimes
    funny editorials. They cover a nice range of topics.

* _[MSDN Magazine][12]_

    Yes Virginia, another [dark empire][13] link. For [Windows][14]
    development, you cannot beat the word of the [evil lord][15]. This
    is also an excellent magazine, regardless of the ties.

* _Java Pro_ (defunct)

    Great magazine for Java17 developers. Very timely articles on
    progress in the Java17 market and not too much in bed with
    [Sun][18].

* _[MacTech][19]_

    Old timer apple people will know this one. I especially love the
    [Programmers Challenge][20] each month. Yes, this one is geared to
    [Macintosh][21]programmers, but you should always know all the
    angles!

* _[Software Development][22]_

    Used to be Computer Language. A very nice magazine that explores the
    design, management, and architecting of software rather than the
    development of it.

* _[Oracle][23] If you develop for [Oracle][24]_ this is their magazine.

    I find it is full of marketing junk, with the exception of one or
    two actually technical articles on managing an [Oracle][24]database.

* _[WebTechniques][25]_

    Wonderful magazine for web developers. Often includes articles on
    [Apache][26], [Perl][27], and other web scripting/development topics.

* _[Dr. Dobbs Journal][28]_

    They had been the cat's meow for a long time. A few years ago, they
    got a little off for me and I let my subscription lapse. Perhaps
    it's time to reconsider.

## Other Items of Interest

So what about all the other stuff? Well there are plenty of items that
did not make the top lists that are still very useful, not to mention
very fun. Here is a collection of items you should investigate if they
peak your interest.

* _[ARRL Handbook][29]_

    No amateur radio person would be complete without knowing about the
    [American Radio Relay League][29] Their publications are second to
    none in the areas of radio (wireless) systems. This is definitely a
    hardware hackers item.

* _[New Hackers Dictionary][30]_ or similarly called [Jargon][31] file.

    If you ever wondered where a geek term came from. This is the
    official source, if there can be one.

* _The Art of Computer Programming_, Volumes 1-3 by Donald E. Knuth.

    The _computer scientist_in me forces me to put this landmark,
    comprehensive set of books on the list somewhere. If it is
    algorithim it is Knuth.

* _Algorithims in C_ by Robert Sedgewick

    An oldie but goody. I understand there is a [Java][17] version now.

* _Godel, Escher, Bach : An Eternal Golden Braid_ by Douglas R. Hofstadter.

    O.k. this may not _technically_be a software/computer book, but the
    essence of and recursiveness in the book applies itself to many
    computer problems. Besides, if you make it through this book, and
    understand half of it, you will be admired by all who know it. A
    former top 10 book for me.

* [O'Riley Publishing][32]

    Perhaps the number one publisher of good UNIX and practical books I
    know of. Especially their series on [Perl][33].

* _[Java Look and Feel Design Guidelines][34]_

    An excellent book, easily extended to programming languages other
    than [Java][17], for developing graphical user interfaces.

* _The Unix Operating System_ by Kaare Christian, Susan Richter.

    My favorite intro to UNIX book. Used in my COS 212 UNIX Operating
    System classes.

* _Applying UML and Patterns_ by Craig Larman.

    I have gone mostly through the abbreviated CD/video version as well
    -- got bored. Text has many good points but is often too dragged
    into details. Repetitive -- as is the iterative cycle pushed in the
    book. Good reading and reference regardless, length just not needed.

* _Core J2EE Patterns_

    Tells you what you will learn, learns you, tells you what you
    learned, then repeats three or four more times. The introduction to
    patterns and the pattern library are essential. There are parts in
    the middle I could have done without. makes me wonder which patterns
    Sun is pushing though Home == Factory!?

* _Art of Java Web Development_ by Neal Ford.

    An excellent diganosis of Java web development. I love his approach
    in leading you down the path to Model 2 and Model-View-Controller
    applications from an application that you think is flexible already.
    Every Java/JSP/Servlet web developer should give this a good read.
    One down fall is that it gets to web frameworks, but does not quite
    give enough information to use them. Regardless this book is an
    excellent overview.

* _[Programming and Customizing PIC Microcontrollers][35]_ by [Myke Predko][36].

    This is not only a great book on the [Microchip][37] [PIC
    Microcontroller][38], it is an excellent hardware book. There are
    many interface circuits and general purpose ideas that are
    incredibly useful. This is my first reference for hardware projects.

## In the Queue

* _[Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship][39]_ by Robert C. Martin.

    I'm just starting this book, but it comes highly recommended. It is
    another in the line of clean, effective, code-writing books that are
    often missing from curriculum and teaching of Computer Science.

## Final Notes

I hope that this reading list has given you some ideas and places to
start researching more computer, software, and hardware topics. In the
future we will refer back to parts of many of these books, magazines,
and other items as backup material.

Until then, "_So long and thanks for all the fish._" (_Hitchhikers Guide
to the Galaxy Trilogy_ by Douglas Adams)
