This course is a bottom up construction of a layered operating system
beginning with the hardware interface and ending with the user
interface. Specific topics covered include concurrent processes, process
management, I/O, virtual memory, file management, resource scheduling,
and performance measurement. Students are assumed to be familiar with
general machine architecture, functions of system software (compilers,
loaders, editors, etc.), data structures, and to have some experience
with UNIX or another multiprogramming operating system.

## About This Semester

Welcome to the <strong>Fall 2016 Operating Systems</strong> course,
<strong>COS 450</strong> and <strong>COS 550</strong>. The start of the
semester is only few weeks away which means I'm spending this otherwise
very nice day glued to my computer preparing course materials for you.
During the first class we will be covering the syllabus and our schedule
for the semester. If you are considering adding the course, please be
in-class on the first day.

This semester will be quite exciting, we are going to work on several
operating system projects in the [Pintos][pintos] operating system.
[Pintos][pintos] was designed
specifically for operating systems courses. It's small and the code is
more easily understood than recent versions of [Linux][linux] which we have used in the past.
There are three projects and they can be quite difficult. To best
prepare yourself, review the materials in the <strong>Resources</strong>
section of the course. Specifically make sure you start reading through
the [Pintos Documentation][pintos-docs].

## Where's The Stuff?

There are three critical sites associated with the course that you will
use frequently:

* [Course Materials][course-site]: for schedule, project documentation, reading, and lecture materials.
* [Blackboard][usm-blackboard]: for project submission, exams, and grades.
* [Pintos Source][pintos]: The Pintos Source code available via `git`

Before our first meeting on Tuesday, September 2nd, you should review
the <strong>Syllabus</strong> for the course (on the 
[Course Materials][course-site] site). There you will
find the schedule, grading, and other information. 

You should also login to [Blackboard][usm-blackboard]. There you
will find an <strong>Orientation Survey</strong>. Please take a few
minutes to fill out the survey. It will help me in making sure you are
best equipped to get through the course successfully.

Lastly, you should start working on getting [Pintos][pintos] up and running
on one of the CS Linux machines or your own Linux-based computer. [Pintos][pintos]
is a complete operating system that will run inside a virtual machine on Linux using
[bochs][bochs] and [qemu][qemu]. We will cover the setup in the first class. For those that want
to get started early, here's a quick install session on [Ubuntu 16.04 LTS][ubuntu].

## Cheaper Textbook!

This semester we are using a condensed (less expensive) version of the
textbook. <em>[Operating System Concepts Essentials][osbook]</em>, 
by Silberschatz, Galvin, and Gange. The [USM Bookstore][usm-bookstore]
should have them in shortly. The [Authors' website][os-book].
contains some helpful additional materials including a study guide.

Enjoy what time remains of your summer, I'm looking forward to seeing
you in class next week.
