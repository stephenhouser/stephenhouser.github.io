  <h2>Textbook</h2>

  <p><em>Operating System Concepts, with Java</em>, 2007, Seventh Edition, Silberschatz, Galvin, and Gagne.</p>

  <h2>Course Objectives</h2>
  <p><em>From the USM Course Catalog</em>: Bottom up construction of a layered operating system beginning with the hardware interface and ending with the user interface. Specific topics covered include concurrent processes, process management, I/O, virtual memory, file management, resource scheduling, and performance measurement. Students are assumed to be familiar with general machine architecture, functions of system software (compilers, loaders, editors, etc.), data structures, and to have some experience with UNIX or another multiprogramming operating system.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>What is an operating system, what parts make it up, what does it do</li>
    <li>Processes, multi-processing, tasking, what are processes, scheduling</li>
    <li>Memory management, virtual memory, paging</li>
    <li>File Systems and I/O Systems</li>
    <li>How to write Operating System modules, code, extensions, etc.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Schedule</h2>
  <p>The following is a preliminary schedule we will try to follow. The reading chapters are out of the textbook. They try to cover material we will be talking about in class. Plan to read the material before class, attend class, and then re-read after class to get the best comprehension.</p>

  <h2>Attendance</h2>

  <p>It cannot be stressed enough that attendance is very important. Many topics will be covered in class that may not be covered in the book. You are responsible for acquiring material missed due to absence.</p>

  <p>Exam make-ups should be scheduled well ahead of time. If that is not possible, you need to make arrangements to take the exam outside of regular class time. Do not assume you can make up a missed exam (University policy).</p>

  <h2>Grading Policy</h2>
  <p>Grades are based on a combination of homework, projects, the final exam, and class participation.</p>

  <table border="0" align="center">
    <tr>
      <td width="250">
        <p>Exams 20% each (3 exams = 60%)</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Projects 10% each (4 projects = 40%)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
